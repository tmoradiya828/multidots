Library Book Search

This exercise is about creating a book listing page with search and sorting
functionality on front-side of a WordPress website.

To achieve this you should register a custom-post type as “book” with two
taxonomies as author and Publisher.

After that, from WordPress Admin Dashboard, add 20-25 manual records and
assign author, publisher, price, Rating (as a number format ) in custom fields.

● BookTite
● Short Description
● Author
● Publisher
● Price (Custom field)
● Rating (Custom field)

Now you have to develop a book listing page with search functionality. The
search should work based on book name, author, publisher, price ( use ranger ),
book rating.
